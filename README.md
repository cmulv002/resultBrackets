# Head to Head

This is a single file piece of code designed to generate head-to-head data for matches for tournaments for an entire year. The code relies on lxml and python for the parsing of the websites and openpyxl for writing the data to a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet included in the repository is a direct result of the code listed. The code is currently suffering from a bug which does not allow it to get past the first step of parsing. However, once this is remedied, the code will be fully functional.


## Prerequisites

```
lxml - https://lxml.de/
openpyxl - https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
```

To run this program, you must use these two libraries. You can install them via pip if you know what you're doing with python. You will also need the requests and string library. Including those is shown in the code.
